It was a fun time! Perhaps some people on this subreddit were also there. In any case, this past year has caused me to stop consuming alcohol pretty much at all, so perhaps I have forgotten my baseline, in any case, at some point I have no recollection of night.\r\n\r\nI remember almost nothing from these wee morning hours except for a friendly sharing of instagram accounts with some nice people I had met and enjoying their company. All I can vaguely recall was that I had seen the sky brightening and I felt an urge to get home, or get to a location to rest, because I had a noon appointment for an Ebay-Kleinanzeigen pickup. Everything after that is completely unclear, and Google Timeline did not record my attempted trip home properly. Therefore, it lists my exit from Hasenheide and the time I supposedly spent outside Prinzenstr. U-Bahn both at 5:25. This places my exit from the party probably somewhere around quarter to 5 or even exactly at the turn of the hour.\r\n\r\nI ended up in Kreuzberg, somehow, in a hof maybe one city block away from Prinzenstr. Ubahn Station. I apparently dozed off in a stairwell whose door was slightly ajar (sorry to the tenants I may have spooked! if any were early risers). I woke up  with my helmet and riding glasses still on. However, my bike was nowhere to be seen. It's possible I locked it nearby and walked? This is the preferable story I tell myself, at least. If I just ditched the bike, I would find it difficult to ever forgive myself.","address":"Berlin, 10969, DE","occurred_at":1621746000,"updated_at":1624428167,"url":"https://bikewise.org/api/v1/incidents/141122","source":{"name":"BikeIndex.org","html_url":"https://bikeindex.org/bikes/837872","api_url":"https://bikeindex.org/api/v1/bikes/837872"},"media":{"image_url":"https://files.bikeindex.org/uploads/Pu/436617/large_DSC02695.JPG","image_url_thumb":"https://files.bikeindex.org/uploads/Pu/436617/small_DSC02695.JPG"},"location_type":null,"location_description":null,"type":"Theft","type_properties":null},{"id":136247,"title":"Stolen 2020 Canyon bicycles RDL AL 6.0 19/20 bu/bu(blue)","description":"Parked in the building courtyard, away from general eyesight.
